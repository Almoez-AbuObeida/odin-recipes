            <p>Some of the best muffins land in that sweet spot between breakfast pastry and dessert. None work better than these chocolate chip muffins. Coming out of the oven with a tender crumb and pops of chocolate, they feel luxurious but are still justifiable before noon.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>
                        <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.</p>
                    <li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>
                        <p>Combine milk, oil, and egg in a small bowl until well blended. Combine flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl, making a well in the center. Pour milk mixture into well and stir until batter is just combined; fold in chocolate chips.</p>
                    <li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
                        <p>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. Mix 3 tablespoons white sugar and brown sugar together in a small bowl; sprinkle on tops of muffins.</p>
                    <li><h3>Step 4</h3></li>
                        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the tin briefly, then transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm or cool completely.</p>
